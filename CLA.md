# Subnautica Modding Nautilus CLA

Any individual who contributes to the Nautilus API following June 20th, 2023 must sign this Contributor License Agreement (CLA). As Nautilus is one of the most popular core modding libraries for Subnautica with a growing number of contributors, this agreement is required due to the virtual impossibility of obtaining approval from all current and previous contributors when making certain decisions.

In the context of this document, "you" refers to the contributor and "we" refers to the Subnautica Modding organization (<https://github.com/SubnauticaModding>).

**By signing this CLA, you agree to the following statements**:
You grant a non-exclusive and transferable license to the Subnautica Modding organization to use, copy, prepare derivatives, distribute and display your contribution on any licensing terms.
You also grant permission to the Subnautica Modding organization to make a fair license change without your approval.

A "fair license change" will not have the intent to restrict future contributions or limit anyone's ability to create derivative works. The Subnautica Modding organization will NEVER sell, commercialize or otherwise restrict the open-source status of Nautilus. A license change may occur following the unanimous decision of all maintainers, which includes anyone who has write access to the repository at the time of making the decision, but also requires the permission of previous contributors who did not sign this CLA.

If you are a prior contributor, you are not bound by the aforementioned statements until signing. However, you are still heavily recommended to sign this CLA and may be required to do so before future PRs are accepted.

To sign this CLA, please add your username to the bottom of this file and send a pull request.
